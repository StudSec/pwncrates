#### Development
A good starting point for development can be found in `/README.md`, under the development subsection. 
`/pwncrates/README.md` contains more detailed information about developing the pwncrates.

When developing, try to maintain a clean code style and limit the commits to one per 'feature', try to avoid a single
commit that implements 2 new features, fixes three bugs and refactors half the code base. This can make it hard to keep
track of the code history.
