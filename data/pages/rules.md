## Rules
The rules boil to "be nice".
#### Don't brute force.
We are just university students so the servers aren't great. Brute forcing has the potential to bring down the challenges for everyone.

#### Don't excessively ask for hints
Don't excessively ask for hints, this does not mean you should shy away from asking for advice or where to start. But don't directly ask for the flag

#### Don't install malware
Installing malware/crypto miners on a compromised challenge is the one bannable offence (for now). Doing so is likely to get us banned from our hosting provider, which is a great way to ruin our day.
